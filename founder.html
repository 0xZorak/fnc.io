        <h2>Help Me Recover and Rebuild My Future</h2>
        <p>For years, I've worked in high-stakes environments, solving complex problems under immense pressure. 
            I pushed myself past my limits time and time again, believing that resilience alone would keep me going.
             But the reality is, no one can outrun burnout forever. This time, I hit a breaking point.</p>
    
        <p>After months of unpaid leave, I found myself battling not only mental exhaustion but a serious health crisis.
             The physical strength I once had is gone, replaced by the toll of an autoimmune condition 
             that took months to diagnose. At the same time, I'm working through a recovery program to break 
             free from the dependencies I developed to keep up with impossible expectations.</p>
    
        <p>Through it all, my wife has carried the weight of our family alone—raising a newborn and a toddler while 
            I've been in and out of treatment. At this stage, they need me more than ever, and I need to get back on my
             feet—not just for myself, but for them.</p>
    
        <p>Now, I have a choice. I can either get forced back into the same cycle,
             or I can take control of my future. I choose the latter. This time, 
             I'm building something sustainable—something that allows me to work on my own terms and take care 
             of my family the right way.</p>
    
        <p>To make that happen, I need <strong>$7,000</strong> to stay on track with my recovery
             and <strong>$3,000</strong> to launch my business, ensuring I never end up in this position again.</p>
    
        <p>If you can help, I'd be incredibly grateful. Every donation, every share, every bit of support 
            makes a real impact. This is my turning point, and I refuse to waste it.</p>
    
        <p>Thank you to everyone who has stood by me. Your support means everything.</p>
